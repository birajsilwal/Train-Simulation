Message
    - Who sent it - I am going to assume that it is always going to originate from
        the station that we want to go to
    - Who is it going to
        - This is going to the station that the train is berthed in
          at the moment
    - What is in the message
        - Coordinates of the station we want to get to
        - What direction we are trying to go to
        - If we are seeking a path
        - If we have found a path
    - Lock information (Lock/unlock Track)

If a good path is found then send the message back along the path.
    - It has the path from the destination station and then all tracks/switches along the way
    - It can be in a linked list since it can grow arbitrarily long.

Logic

Click on the des Station
    - StartStat makes message
    - Message -> track0 ->track1->...->DesStation
    - Valid path, or not valid path.
    Options
        1 - Send a new message back to the station
        2 - send a message right to the train
    Train departs
